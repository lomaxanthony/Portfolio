          I’m an endlessly curious tinkerer who’s always exploring new ideas, tools, and ways to make things better — whether that’s improving myself, the tech I work with, or the way things function.

        <p className="intro-text">
          I have spent the last decade as a Manager at Woodstock's Pizza Parlor. During that time I found myself constantly looking for small ways to improve systems and workflows — whether it was reorganizing stations for better flow, tweaking techniques to improve consistency, or experimenting with better ways to train new team members. I like asking “why” and “what if” — and then testing the answers.

          I love digging into how things work, breaking them (sometimes on purpose), and building them back smarter.

          This site is a snapshot of what I’ve been up to — projects, experiments, and whatever’s currently got my attention. Thanks for stopping by!
